# Image Histogram Enhancement

This repository contains the implementation of histogram processing techniques to enhance images. The project includes grayscale and color image histogram plotting, contrast and brightness stretching for grayscale images, and perfect histogram equalization for grayscale images.

## Aim
To study and perform histogram processing techniques in image enhancement.

## Features
1. **Plot a Histogram:**
   - Generate histograms for grayscale and color images.
   
2. **Contrast and Brightness Stretching:**
   - Perform enhancement by stretching contrast and brightness of grayscale images.

3. **Perfect Histogram Equalization:**
   - Apply perfect histogram equalization on grayscale images for improved image quality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

## Usage
1. **Histogram Plotting:**
   - Use the script to generate histograms for grayscale and color images.

2. **Contrast and Brightness Stretching:**
   - Adjust contrast and brightness of a given grayscale image using provided methods.

3. **Perfect Histogram Equalization:**
   - Enhance grayscale images by applying histogram equalization.
     
## Outputs
- **Histograms** for grayscale and color images.
- **Enhanced images** showing contrast and brightness adjustments.
- **Equalized images** demonstrating the effects of histogram equalization.
